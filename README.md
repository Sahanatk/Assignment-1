* Lists: specify the unordered elements with asterisk will give each element block points and even lists can be nested.Also ordered elements can be listed as the way user wants          to be.
* Images: Two types of displaying images using inline and refernce
          ![img name](path or link)-inline style
          [img name][ref name]
          [ref name]:link/path "img alternative"-reference style
* Links: Two types of links using inline and refernce
         [name](link)-inline style
         [name][ref name]

Outling the webpage
This webpage is very simple and it has been created using basic html elements like <p>,<br> and <h1> which makes webpage looks very different.Without these tags it would be just combination of words which doesn't make any good sense to the reader.
